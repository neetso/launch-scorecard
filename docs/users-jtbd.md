**1. Banking/finance analyst types who'd care about this data**

The obvious ones from your spec are equity research (TMT coverage), but there are several other seats in a bank or fund that would find this useful:

- **Equity research associates (TMT/software)** — The core user. They need to verify management claims against actual shipping evidence, especially around earnings. "Did the feature they hyped on the call actually ship?"
- **Investment banking (tech M&A / coverage)** — When pitching or advising on a deal involving a tech company, the execution track record matters. A target that consistently ships on time vs. one that over-promises is a real diligence input.
- **Credit / fixed-income analysts** — Less obvious, but relevant for high-yield tech issuers. Execution risk on a product roadmap feeds into credit quality assessments, especially for companies where revenue depends on shipping new capabilities (think a smaller cloud player or AI-first company).
- **Buy-side PMs and sector analysts (long/short equity, hedge funds)** — They'd use it for variant perception: "The market thinks Feature X is coming in Q3, but the evidence says it's slipping." That's alpha.
- **VC/growth equity due diligence teams** — Pre-investment, they want to benchmark a portfolio company's competitive landscape. "How fast does the incumbent actually ship vs. announce?" informs market timing.
- **Sell-side strategists / thematic research** — The people writing "State of AI" or "Cloud Wars" reports. Your cross-company ship-rate data is exactly the kind of proprietary dataset they'd cite.
- **Compliance / ESG teams** (stretch) — If a company makes public commitments about AI safety or governance features, tracking whether those shipped is a governance signal.

**2. Jobs-to-be-done: \*when\* do they reach for the tool?**

This varies by persona, but the trigger moments cluster around a few patterns:

**Equity research associate:**

- *Earnings prep* — "Management said X would launch in Q2. Did it? I need the evidence before I write my preview note."
- *Post-keynote, same day* — "I need to quickly understand what was announced and how it compares to prior event delivery rates."
- *Initiating/updating coverage* — "I'm writing up the competitive section. Who actually ships what they promise?"

**IB coverage / M&A:**

- *Pitchbook assembly* — "I need a credible slide on Company X's execution track record vs. peers."
- *Due diligence on a target* — "How many of their announced features actually reached GA? What's the pattern?"

**Buy-side PM / hedge fund analyst:**

- *Position sizing / conviction check* — "The bull case depends on this product shipping. What does the evidence actually say?"
- *Monitoring an existing position* — Alert-driven: "Something I'm watching just slipped from Preview to Delayed."
- *Short thesis construction* — "Show me everything that's overdue by 90+ days for Company Y."

**VC/PE platform team:**

- *Competitive landscape for a portfolio company* — "How fast is the incumbent shipping AI features? Are they actually delivering or just announcing?"
- *Board prep* — "Here's how our portfolio company's shipping cadence compares to the market."

**Newsletter writer / independent analyst:**

- *Weekly content production* — "What moved to GA this week? What slipped? Give me the chart."
- *Event coverage* — "I need the scorecard within 24 hours to publish before everyone else."

The common thread: users reach for your tool at **decision moments where the gap between narrative and evidence matters** — earnings, investment decisions, competitive analysis, and content deadlines. The tool is least useful for casual browsing and most useful when someone needs a defensible, citable answer under time pressure.
